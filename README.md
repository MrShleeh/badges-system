# Badges System
Welcome to the badges problem Guide.
I can help you to remove by every badge the spaces with better-sqlite3.
If you have questions about the sqlite databases. DM me in Discord with the name `Pluide#1234`.

## Installation:
```
npm i better-sqlite3 --save
npm i discord.js --save
```
## Showcase -> index.js
First I create a database in the main file.
For me is `index.js`. You can name it what you want.
```js
const sqlite = require('better-sqlite3')
const discord = require('discord.js')
const client = new discord.Client()

client.on('ready', async() => {

})
```
