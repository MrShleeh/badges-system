# Badges System Problem
Welcome to the badges problem Guide.
I can help you to remove by every badge the spaces with better-sqlite3.
If you have questions about the sqlite databases. DM me in Discord with the name `Pluide#1234`.

## Installation:
```
npm i better-sqlite3 --save
```
## Showcase -> index.js
```js
const sqlite = require('better-sqlite3')
```
